This is the final Project for the Univerity class Object Oriented Programming.

I created this Project along with [Marikaiti Primenda](https://github.com/marikaitiprim) in my second year.

I am especially proud for this project, since I was adequatelly challenged, I learned a lot about programming and thinking outside of the box and we managed to create an interactive game that works on any Linux and Windows Terminal.

This project, has a makefile, so in order to compile it and run it, all toy have to do is run:

make [the name of your executable]
and then simply run your executable.
